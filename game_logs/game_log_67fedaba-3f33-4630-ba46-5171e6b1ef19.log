2025-03-14 13:55:38,666 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): The topic might be something common and widely used, possibly a household item. Since it can be found in most households, it could be a common appliance, tool, or everyday object. I'm not sure about the exact topic yet, but this narrows it down. I have more steps left to guess, so I'll ask about its function next.[0m

2025-03-14 13:55:53,672 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): I've started by narrowing down whether the topic is about something living, which will help me determine if we're focusing on animals, plants, or other biological entities. This will guide my next questions.[0m

2025-03-14 13:55:54,755 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): The topic is not related to animals in any way. Blade Runner is a film that deals with themes of artificial intelligence and humanity, rather than living beings classified as animals.[0m
