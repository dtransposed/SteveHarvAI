2025-03-14 15:35:13,759 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): Generated topic: Emerald from category: Objects/Gemstones. Reasoning: I selected this topic because gemstones have specific identifying features that can be explored through yes or no questions, making it a perfect fit for the 20 questions format. Players can ask about color, origin, and historical significance, which adds depth to the game.[0m

This helps eliminate a broad range of possibilities and gives me a clearer direction. Right now, I don't have enough information to guess the specific topic. I have several steps left to identify the topic.[0m
