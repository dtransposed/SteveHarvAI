2025-03-13 07:36:36,682 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): So far, I know I need to guess a tangible object. Tangible objects are physical items that can be touched or seen. To narrow down the possibilities, I should ask about specific categories such as its use or location. This will help me determine if it's something used in daily life, technology, nature, etc.[0m

It is commonly found indoors because people typically wear them all the time, including when inside their homes, offices, or other buildings. Additionally, a smartwatch can be used for tasks that are common indoors, such as checking notifications, tracking fitness indoors, or controlling other smart devices within a home.[0m
