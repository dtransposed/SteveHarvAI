Since I have established that it is a feng shui item, I want to narrow it down further by asking if it is a specific type of feng shui item that is commonly known for attracting wealth. This will help me identify the specific item. I have 3 steps left, so I need to be strategic in my questioning.[0m

Since it is not a wealth-attracting item, I want to explore if it is a feng shui item that is commonly associated with harmony or balance, such as a yin-yang symbol or a specific type of plant. This could help me identify the specific item. I have 1 step left, so I need to make this question count.[0m
