2025-03-14 15:53:04,362 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): Generated topic: Sherlock Holmes from category: Culture/Literary Characters. Reasoning: I chose this topic because it's a popular and iconic character within its genre. It's well-known but not overly obvious, making it a fun challenge for players to guess. This character opens up a lot of interesting questions and avenues for guessing, aligning with the spirit of 20 Questions where diverse thinking is encouraged.[0m

2025-03-14 16:02:54,786 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): The topic could involve living organisms, which would narrow it down significantly. This question helps determine if the subject is a part of the biological domain or not. I have many steps left, but this will set the direction for subsequent questions.[0m

2025-03-14 16:02:58,903 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): The question asks if it is an animal, but the topic is Sherlock Holmes, a fictional detective character. This doesn't directly relate to Sherlock Holmes, as he is not an animal, but a human detective. Therefore, the question is not aligned with the topic.[0m
