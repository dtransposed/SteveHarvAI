While it is home to various marine animals, the trench itself is a geological feature. The question about animal physiology is not directly related to the geological nature of the Mariana Trench, but indirectly, it could be related since organisms in the trench have unique physiological adaptations to survive in such an extreme environment. However, the main topic is geological rather than biological.[0m
