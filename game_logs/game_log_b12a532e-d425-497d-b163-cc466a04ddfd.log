2025-03-14 15:45:40,847 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): I started by asking if the device is related to communication, and now I'm narrowing it down by asking whether it's portable. This question will help me determine if the topic could be something like a smartphone or a radio. I still have several steps left, so I'm trying to refine my focus onto specific categories of devices.[0m
2025-03-14 15:45:40,847 - [32mGuesser: Does this communication device use the internet?[0m
2025-03-14 15:45:45,078 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): The topic is 'Electric Guitar,' which is a musical instrument and not primarily a communication device. The question asks about the use of the internet, which isn't related to how an electric guitar functions or its primary purpose.[0m

2025-03-14 15:45:50,289 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): The question about broadcasting suggests a wide-reaching communication method, possibly involving radio or television. Broadcasting typically involves transmitting signals to multiple receivers simultaneously. Understanding whether the device is used for broadcasting will help narrow it down to devices like radios, televisions, or transmitters.

The first question asked about broadcast suggests looking into the scale of communication and might guide us towards larger scale communication devices used for mass media.

I still have several steps left to make a confident guess.[0m

2025-03-14 15:45:54,256 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): The question asks about a communication device used by the general public for entertainment. An electric guitar is primarily a musical instrument, not a communication device, although it does provide entertainment. Since the question focuses on a communication device, it does not align with the topic of the electric guitar.[0m
