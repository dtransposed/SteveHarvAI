This will help narrow down whether the topic is about animals, plants, or something entirely different. I have several steps left to guess the topic, so I need more information.[0m

2025-03-14 14:53:00,332 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): The question 'Is it found in nature?' is not directly related to the topic. The topic is about playing the game Twenty Questions, where Yes or No questions are aimed to identify a specific object or concept. However, this question could be relevant depending on the chosen object or concept in a specific game instance. Generally, the question itself is generic and needs context to determine its relevance.[0m
