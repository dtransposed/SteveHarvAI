Reasoning: I chose the topic of the Komodo Dragon because it offers a unique challenge for a 20 questions game. It's a distinctive creature with specific characteristics that can lead to interesting questions about its habitat, size, and behavior, making it an engaging subject.[0m

2025-03-14 07:28:08,614 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): So far, I know you're asking about something commonly found indoors. This narrows it down to objects, concepts, or activities that typically occur or are located within enclosed spaces. This question will help me determine if we are dealing with common household items, indoor activities, or concepts related to indoor spaces. I still need to gather more specific details to make an accurate guess. I'm thinking of items or activities related to everyday life inside a home or building. Still have a few steps left.[0m
