2025-03-14 15:06:09,315 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): Generated topic: Croissant from category: Food/Dessert. Reasoning: This topic is both accessible and intriguing as it involves a well-known type of pastry that can lead to interesting questions about ingredients, baking, and flavors. It's broad enough to keep the game engaging, yet specific enough to require careful questioning.[0m

2025-03-14 15:06:15,954 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): The question about whether the topic is a living organism has already been asked, indicating that the topic is not a living thing. This helps narrow down options significantly to objects or concepts. Given that it's not living, the topic might be an inanimate object or an abstract concept. Since we only have a few steps left, I need to narrow down further by asking more targeted yes/no questions. I've eliminated anything related to animals, plants, fungi, and similar entities.[0m
