2025-03-14 16:25:48,010 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): Generated topic: Rainbow Eucalyptus from category: Nature/Trees. Reasoning: The rainbow eucalyptus is a visually striking and unique tree known for its vibrant, multicolored bark. This makes it an interesting and challenging topic for a game of 20 questions, as it may not be immediately obvious and requires curiosity about nature.[0m
