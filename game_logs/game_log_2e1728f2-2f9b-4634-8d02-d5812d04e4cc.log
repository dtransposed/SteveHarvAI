2025-03-14 15:44:39,515 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): Generated topic: Ukulele from category: Objects/Musical Instruments. Reasoning: I chose "Ukulele" because it's a distinct musical instrument with a growing popularity. It's not as commonly chosen as guitars, making it an interesting and balanced challenge for 20 Questions.[0m

2025-03-14 15:44:44,004 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): The question about a living organism suggests that the topic could potentially be biological or related to life forms. By clarifying if itâ€™s a living organism, I narrow down the scope to either biological entities or non-living things. This question will help move towards identifying a specific category, which is a big step in specifying the topic.[0m
