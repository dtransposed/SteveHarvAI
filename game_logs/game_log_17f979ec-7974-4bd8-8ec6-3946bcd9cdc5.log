2025-03-18 08:58:13,907 - [32mGuesser (internal dialogue): Since the topic is man-made, I should now focus on the category of the object. A useful question would be to determine if it is a physical object used for a specific purpose, such as a tool or a machine, or if it's something else. Asking if it is a tool could help distinguish its function.[0m
2025-03-18 08:58:13,908 - [32mGuesser: Is the topic a tool?[0m
2025-03-18 08:58:16,085 - [34mHost (internal dialogue): The Tesla Model S is primarily classified as a vehicle rather than a tool.
