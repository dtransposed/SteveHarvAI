Reasoning: I chose this topic because it adds a fun and challenging dimension to the game, allowing players to explore and deduce a broad array of human experiences and accomplishments. It also encourages questions that probe into the nature and impact of human actions.[0m

Asking if it's a living thing is a straightforward way to narrow down possibilities. Knowing if it's alive will guide further questions about nature, biology, or if I should consider inanimate objects instead. I have several steps left, so Iâ€™m keeping my options open.[0m
